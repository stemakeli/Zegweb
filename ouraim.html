        <h1 id="h1blk">Our Aim at Zegweb.com</h1><br>
        <p id="aim">
        To encourage the use of code in static website development in a modern society
        where the use of "CMS" ( Content Management System ) is prevalent. We aim to keep website 
        development simple, with easy to follow code but yet designing modern looking and stylish 
        websites. We also strive to offer FREE static website hosting for your website courtesy 
        of "Github" and "Netlify" so keeping costs down so any cost incured is purely for our 
        services as web designers to put tobether the best website at a reasonable cost. And 
        what's more amazing is it includes a "FREE" SSL certificate which most web host charge for.</p>

        <h2 id="h2blk">Simplicity in itself</h2><br>
        <p id="aim">
        So you want a static website? Maybe for business, a hobby, just to let the world know that
         you have a service to offer. Do an internet search for website building and you will 
         be bombarded with countless web hosts offerering their services. They will offer FREE 
         websites but these are limited to "sub-domains". To take advantage of their benefits,
         you will have to sign up for a monthly fee, only then will you get a "FREE" SSL and 
         your own domain, which you have a choice of buying from them or elswhere. There are plenty 
         of sites available offering good prices for Domain Names. Whether going for a sub-domain or you own domain
         you will be able to use their CMS, the most popular beign "Wordpress". That's fine if that's what you want 
         but you will still be limited in what you can design unless you go for a premium package to open up all features.
         <br>
         Our site aims to give you a full featured static site for a fraction of the cost compared to signing up 
         for a web host - CMS - SSL - yearly fees - leading to more complex code ( in the background ) with more 
         complex breakages, meaning having to spend more to put it right. Keeping it simple is simplicity in itself!</p>
